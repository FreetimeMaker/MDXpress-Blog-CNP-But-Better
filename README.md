# 🚀 MD Blog

**MD Blog** is a serverless-friendly version of the original [MDXpress Blog](https://github.com/eshan-singh78/MDXpress-Blog/), reworked to deploy seamlessly on platforms like **Vercel** using **Serverless Functions**.

It’s a markdown-powered, minimal blogging platform that compiles content on-the-fly without any backend server, database, or complex setup.

- All backend logic is handled via Serverless Functions in `/api`.
- Static assets (styles, markdown files) are served from `/public`.
- HTML templates are combined with rendered Markdown and returned as HTML.
